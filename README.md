# THE Tech Blog Website

## Description

The motivation behind building this project was and is to have code that encompasses a numerous amount of content that was covered in this week's MVC module. This application serves as a website where users can sign up and create blog posts as well as comment on other users' blog posts. I learned a lot about the Model, View, Controller dynamic and how they all interact.

This project still needs a lot of work. Much of the styling was copied from the mini project in order for me to focus on the functionality. The styling will be edited later.
